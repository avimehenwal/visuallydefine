No, this is not the slowest way to learn the alphabet. Instead, it means that if you commit to something, commit to it all the way. Don’t half-ass things or cherry pick. It is for those people who approach things with the attitude of Wasch mir den Pelz aber mach mich nicht nass (wash my fur but don’t get me wet), meaning they only want the outcome but not make the sacrifices that lead there.
