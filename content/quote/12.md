The perfect is the enemy of the good. A lot of people wait for the elusive
“perfect moment”. When the stars align and everything falls into place. But life doesn’t work like that. This saying tells us to work with what we have available, not what we would like to have. Or to quote Theodore Roosevelt: “Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.”
