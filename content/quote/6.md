Many of us live in cultures that are very avert to failure. Nobody likes
to screw up or fall on their face. However, what a lot of people forget is
that failure is a necessity for learning. Without making mistakes, you will
never understand how to do it right. To quote Samuel Beckett: â€œEver tried.
Ever failed. No matter. Try again, fail again, fail better.
