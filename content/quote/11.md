This one is a little bit like “don’t count your chickens before they hatch”.
However, while the English version asks us not to rely on means which we do
not possess at this time, the German equivalent expresses the futility of
worrying about things that haven’t come to pass yet and never might. It is
energy that is much better spent productively.
