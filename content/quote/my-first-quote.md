All beginnings are hard.
<!--more-->

No matter what you are undertaking in life, whether it’s learning a new language,
embarking on a career or working on a project, if you start something from scratch,
you will suck at it at first. That’s part of the natural order and the way it should be.
Don’t worry too much about it and just keep at it until you get it right.
