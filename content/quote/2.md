In German, putting something on the “long bench” means putting it off
<!--more-->
(etwas auf die lange Bank schieben – another very good addition to your German slang phrases).
Seems like Germans knew about procrastination long before the word was on everyone’s lips.
What are you putting on the “long bench” that you could take care of right now?
Don’t let the devil win.
