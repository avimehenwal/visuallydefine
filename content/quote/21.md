If motivation runs low, one of the hardest things to do is to get started. Yes, we want to learn German. Yes, we committed to this time for our studying session. But we just donâ€™t feel like it. Do a little bit, study for just a minute. More often than not your will find that after working for a while and easing into the process, it actually becomes fun and you will want to continue.
