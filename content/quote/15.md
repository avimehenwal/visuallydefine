This saying is hard to translate literally. It’s English equivalent is “Self do, self have”. Oftentimes we will use waiting for others as an excuse in order to not take action. The proverb says that if you want something done, you have to do it yourself. While the original is the male version,  Selbst ist die Frau is also widely used today.
