This might be the most weird-sounding translation on the list (which German is prone to, check out the German vocabulary with surprising meanings for more). It is one of the ways Germans stress the importance of getting up early to get a head start on the day. Many inventors and creators of our time have been early risers who have used the first hours of the day as their most productive period. Highly recommended.
